# stock-price-predict-with-NN
This repository is for the artical The Application of Stock Index Price Prediction with Neural Network.

As for LSTM, CNN and MLP, the three models are implemented in PyTorch 1.4.
And for UA model, it is implemented in Tensorflow 1.13.

Before running the above code, you should change the save path to your own.

To run the model, for example, python stock_lstm.py -d sp500.  -d means appointing the dataset you want to test.
